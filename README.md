# authorship-attribution

A small app that determines authorship by calculating n-gram frequency.

The app has a handful of authors that it knows through 1 or 2 works. It generates profiles on each author and then compares the profile created by an unknown text to determine which of the authors it already knows was most likely to have written the unknown work.

# how to
npm install and npm start

#to do
As of right now, the app can only generate profiles based on .txt files that are saved in the text folder. I would like to allow for people to copy and paste in text or upload files. I would also like to add styling.
